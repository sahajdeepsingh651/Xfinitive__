14. Violation of These Terms of Use



You agree that XFinitive may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate your access to the Services and/or any related websites or applications if XFinitive determines in its sole discretion that you have violated these Terms.
XFinitive may disclose any information it has about you, including your identity, if it determines that such disclosure is necessary as part of any investigation or complaint regarding your use of the Services, or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with XFinitive’s rights or property, or another person’s rights or property. XFinitive reserves the right to disclose any information XFinitive deems necessary to comply with any Applicable Laws, and also when it determines that Applicable Laws permit such disclosure, including exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection purposes.
You acknowledge and agree that XFinitive may preserve any communication by you with XFinitive through the Services and/or the Affiliated Services or any service offered on or through the Services and/or the Affiliated Services, and may disclose such communications when required by Applicable Laws or if XFinitive deems that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with legal process; (2) enforce these Terms; (3) respond to a claim that any communication, information posted on the Services, the Affiliated Services, or Content violates the rights of others; or (4) protect the rights, property or personal safety of XFinitive and its employees, users of or visitors to the Services and/or the Affiliated Services, and/or the public.
If XFinitive takes legal action against you as a result of your violation of these Terms, XFinitive will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to pay, all reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief granted to XFinitive. You agree that XFinitive will not be liable to you or to any third party for termination of your access to the Services and/or the Affiliated Services or removal of any communication or posting of information by you, or contents thereof, as a result of any violation of these Terms.
15. Void Where Prohibited



XFinitive reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any Service, Content, or feature, product, or service thereof to any person or geographic area, whether by reason of the local laws applicable in such geographic area or otherwise. Any offer for any feature, product, or service made on the Services and/or the Affiliated Services is void where prohibited.
16. Modification or Termination of the Services


These Terms will remain in full force and effect as long as you continue to access, use or download the Services. You may terminate your use of the Services at any time by ceasing to use the Services. If you are a registered account holder, you may terminate your account by contacting us at help@XFinitive.com. If you terminate your account, your account may remain active until the end of your then-current month.
XFinitive may, in its sole and absolute discretion and without any liability, change, discontinue, make improvements to, modify, or suspend, any aspect or all of the Services and/or the Affiliated Services, temporarily or permanently, at any time and for any reason without prior notice. XFinitive may notify you of these changes by updating the posting of these Terms or by other means (e.g., via email). Upon any termination of these Terms, all rights granted to you under these Terms will cease. You shall comply immediately with any termination or other notice, including, as applicable, by ceasing all use of the Services. XFinitive is under no obligation to retain a record of your account or any data or information that you may have used, disclosed, processed, retrieved, transmitted, or viewed on XFinitive.
17. Governing Law


These Terms of Use shall be governed, construed and applied in all respects by the laws of New Jersey, without regard to any provision governing conflicts of law. 
18. Arbitration


Any and all controversies, claims, or disputes arising out of, relating to, or connected with these Terms of Use or your use of the Services and/or the Affiliated Services shall be referred to and settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the provisions set forth under the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and any other applicable rules and procedures (“Rules”) by a panel of three arbitrators appointed in compliance with the Rules. This includes all disputes over arbitrability.
The Parties to this Agreement further acknowledge and agree that:

18.1. the location of the arbitration, including the location of all arbitration hearings, shall be New Jersey;

18.2. the arbitral award shall address the costs and expenses of arbitration and all matters related thereto, including, the allocation of same between the parties; 
18.3. the award of the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties; and

18.4. the parties submit to the jurisdiction of the federal courts of New Jerey for the purposes of ratifying any award made pursuant to arbitration proceedings conducted in accordance with this clause and/or may enforce the award through such courts. 
By using the Services and/or the Affiliated Services, you expressly waive your right to pursue all controversies, claims, or disputes in court and instead must submit any such controversies, claims, or disputes to arbitration as described above. 
19. Waiver of Class and Joint Claims


Any arbitration (or, if arbitration of the action is not permitted by law, litigation) shall be solely on behalf of an individual person, and shall not be consolidated or joined with the claims of any other person or brought on behalf of a putative class unless previously agreed to in writing by both you and XFinitive or you and eClinicalWorks, LLC.
20. Force Majeure



We will not be deemed to be in breach of these Terms or liable for any breach of these Terms or our Privacy Policy due to any event or occurrence beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation, acts of God, terrorism, war, invasion, failures of any public networks, electrical shortages, Internet outage, labor disturbance, earthquakes or floods, civil disorder, strikes, fire, pandemics, epidemics, or other disaster (including without limitation, natural, technological, or social).
21. Miscellaneous



21.1. Severability



If any provision of these Terms are ruled by a court, arbitral tribunal, administrative officer or other entity of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such provision(s) shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with a valid provision that best furthers the intent of these Terms, with all remaining provisions remaining in full force and effect.
21.2. Entire Agreement


These Terms and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and XFinitive with regard to your access and use of the Services and/or the Affiliated Services. No counter-offers to these Terms of Use shall be accepted by XFinitive, and XFinitive rejects all such counter-offers.
21.3. Assignment



XFinitive may assign its rights, in whole or in part, in the Services and/or the Affiliated Services in accordance with its sole discretion.
21.4. No Agency


Nothing contained in these Terms creates any agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between you and XFinitive.
21.5. No Waiver


XFinitive’s failure or delay to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or any right that XFinitive has to enforce these Terms of Use.
21.6. Time Period for Filing Claims



You acknowledge and agree that it is the intent of both you and XFinitive to limit the period of time in which a claim may be filed, even if the period is shorter than that fixed by the statute of limitations. You therefore agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to XFinitive must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, otherwise such cause of action is permanently barred.
21.7. No Third Party Beneficiary


These Terms of Use do not confer any rights or remedies on any third parties.
