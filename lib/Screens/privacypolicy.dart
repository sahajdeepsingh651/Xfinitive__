  1. Introduction :
  1.1. This Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) informs you what Personal Information XFinitive (“XFinitive,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) may collect, how XFinitive collects such Personal Information, how XFinitive uses such Personal Information in connection with the Services we provide to you or our customers (i.e., Providers as defined below), and your choices related to your Personal Information. This Privacy Policy also provides additional information required under California law about our collection, use and disclosure of the information of California residents from both online and offline sources, along with other required information such as rights that may be available to California residents.


  1.1.1. “Services” means XFinitive’s products and services, such as our websites (“Sites”), electronic medical records systems, practice management systems, healthcare provider customer portals (“Provider Portals”), patient portals (“Patient Portals,” collectively with Provider Portals, “Portals”), software and mobile applications for the foregoing, etc
  

  1.2. In this Privacy Policy, we do not include Protected Health Information in the definition of Personal Information because, as discussed in Sections 2 and 4, Protected Health Information has different treatment under HIPAA (as defined below), other applicable laws, and the Customer Documents (as defined below). Accordingly, because Protected Health Information is handled differently under the Customer Documents, if you are a patient of a Provider (as defined below), your Protected Health Information is subject to the Customer Documents and your Provider’s terms of service and privacy practices.


  1.3. This Privacy Policy applies wherever it is posted, and it is part of and incorporated into applicable Terms of Use Agreements ("Terms of Use") for the Sites, the Portals, and other Services, and into any applicable Terms and Conditions for our software and mobile applications ("Terms and Conditions"). Any terms capitalized herein but not defined shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the applicable Terms of Use or Terms and Conditions. By visiting or using the Services or otherwise affirming the acceptance of an agreement into which this Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference, you acknowledge and agree to accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your Personal Information. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Services. This Privacy Policy is not a contract and does not create any contractual rights or obligations. Your use of the Services is governed by the applicable Terms of Use or Terms and Conditions of the respective Services.


  1.4. Please note that some privacy rights and obligations may differ in certain locations based on local law, in which case XFinitive will comply with the local legal requirements. If you are a California resident, our Privacy Notice for California Residents in Section 18 may apply to you. XFinitive reserves the right, at any time, to modify this Privacy Policy. If we make revisions that change the way we collect, use, or share Personal Information, we will post those changes in this Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we may also notify you by other means prior to the changes taking effect, such as by posting a notice on our Site or sending you a notification. You should review this Privacy Policy periodically so that you keep up to date on our most current policies and practices. XFinitive will note the effective date of the latest version of our Privacy Policy at the beginning of this Privacy Policy.


  1.5. Employees and job applicants who are California residents receive a supplemental privacy notice that applies to their relationship with XFinitive in the context of their employment or job application. In the event of any conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms of the supplementary employee notice will control.

  2.1.1. “Personal Information” is information that identifies an individual or relates to an identifiable individual or household. The types of Personal Information collected, and the uses thereof depend on the purposes for which we collect the Personal Information (e.g., whether you are a visitor to our Sites, a user of our Portals, or a customer of our Services). As used in this Privacy Policy, Personal Information does not include Protected Health Information.


  2.1.2. “Protected Health Information” or “PHI” is individually identifiable health information that is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its implementing regulations (“HIPAA”).


  2.1.3. “Usage Data” is information that we automatically collect about your use of the Sites and includes the sort that Web browsers and servers typically make available, through Web server logs, Web beacons, cookies and other similar tracking technologies, about the devices you use to access our Sites, as well as information on how you interact with our Sites. We do not deploy non-essential third-party cookies or similar tracking technologies on the Portals; however, we may collect log information including Usage Data for internal uses or uses by our service providers on our behalf, such as ensuring the security and integrity of our Services. Usage Data may include the IP address of a device or internet service used to connect your device to the Internet and may provide information about your Location; computer and connection information such as your browser type and version; operating system and platform; confirmation when you open e-mail that we send you; purchase history; and the URLs which lead you to and around the Site including the date and time of access. Usage Data may overlap with Location Information. Usage Data generally does not directly identify an individual, but may constitute Personal Information in some instances.


  3. How we Collect Your Personal Information :


  3.1. XFinitive uses information collected from users of the Services to personalize and improve your visit and experience, to provide the Services to you or our customers, and for other purposes set out below. When you use the Services, XFinitive may collect Personal Information in the following ways described below.


  3.2 Information You Provide to XFinitive: XFinitive collects Personal Information when you use and interact with the Services, such as when you:


  3.2.1. Communicate with XFinitive about our Services whether by letter, e-mail, online chat window, or telephone;


  3.2.2. Complete and submit forms to us on our Sites or Provider Portals (e.g., to register for an account on a Provider Portal, 
  authenticate yourself to verify your authorized use of the Services, to register for our events, or to subscribe to our newsletters);

  3.3 Information that XFinitive Collects Automatically: When you use the Services, XFinitive may automatically collect Usage Data subject to the settings of your device that you use to access the Services. With your consent, we may also collect information from your device to facilitate your use of certain features of the Services. XFinitive may use this data to analyze trends and statistics to improve your online experience or our customer service. We do not deploy non-essential third-party cookies or similar tracking technologies on our Portals but may collect Usage Data for purposes such as ensuring the security and integrity of our Services.


  3.4 Information from Other Sources: XFinitive may collect Personal Information from other sources such as the Internet and other publicly-available sources and databases, data aggregators, marketing companies, and other third parties, including sources from which you authorize us to obtain Personal Information about you on your behalf. If you authorize us to collect information from a third party, or if you authorize a third party to send us information, and you later decide that you no longer want us to obtain that information, you may need to contact the third-party source directly and request that they stop transmitting information to us. For example, if you submit claims to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), you may decide to authorize us to obtain information directly from CMS. For more information about how those third parties collected and used your Personal Information, please review the privacy policy of the respective third party.


  4. Protected Health Information; XFinitive as a Business Associate :


  4.1 Certain Services we provide to our customers or make available to their patients, such as the Portals, as well as certain support operations, involve access to, and the processing of, PHI. This PHI is provided to us pursuant to a service agreement, business associate agreement, or other document with terms and conditions for the Services (the “Customer Documents”) that we have entered with our customers (health care providers or their firms, “Providers”) that also govern our use of PHI of their patients provided by our Provider customers or their patient users.


  4.1.1 This Privacy Policy supplements the Customer Documents. XFinitive only uses such PHI as a “business associate” of its Providers, who are “covered entities,” in accordance with any instructions or restrictions provided to XFinitive by the Provider and in full compliance with the applicable provisions of HIPAA.


  4.1.2 If you are a patient of a Provider, our use and disclosure of your Protected Health Information is governed by HIPAA and other applicable law and the Customer Documents with your Provider – not by this Privacy Policy. Your Provider’s collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of such PHI are governed, in turn, by your Provider’s terms and conditions and privacy practices between you and your Provider. Please submit all requests and questions related to your PHI directly to your Provider. We are not responsible for how our Provider customers treat PHI we collect on their behalf, and we recommend you review their own privacy policies.


  4.1.3 Our Sites are generally not intended to collect or retain any PHI. Thus, sections of this Privacy Policy that discuss Personal Information collection on the Sites do not apply to PHI, and we do not request, obtain, use or disclose any PHI through our Sites such as www.XFinitive.com.

  Communicate with users about our products, services, and related issues. We may use your information to try to identify if you may be interested in any of the Services or our business partners’ products and services.

  6.2. Notice Concerning Do Not Track: Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above and recognize “Global Privacy Control” through our vendor, OneTrust.

XFinitive may collect sensitive personal information from certain online sources, including password information in the course of users accessing our registration system, and driver’s license and state identification numbers in some instances.  18.5 CCPA/CPRA Consumer Rights :
California residents may have certain consumer rights. These rights may include:
The right to know what CCPA/CPRA Personal Information we collect, including (1) the right to request information regarding the categories of CCPA/CPRA Personal Information we collect along with other information such as the categories of sources from which the information is collected and third parties with whom it is shared and (2) the right to request a copy of the specific pieces of CCPA/CPRA Personal Information we collect (sometimes referred to as the right to access personal information);
The right to delete CCPA/CPRA Personal Information that we collect from you, subject to certain exceptions;The right to correct inaccurate CCPA/CPRA Personal Information that we maintain about you;The right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of CCPA/CPRA Personal Information; The right to opt-out of certain uses of CCPA/CPRA Sensitive Personal Information; and The right not to be retaliated or discriminated against for exercising any CCPA/CPRA rights in good faith. XFinitive will not discriminate against you for exercising any of the abovementioned rights, for example, by charging a different price or denying goods or services. However, XFinitive may charge a different price or rate or provide a different level or quality of goods or services when that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to us by the data.
You may also limit the use and disclosure of your CCPA/CPRA Personal Information by either unsubscribing from marketing communications or contacting XFinitive at the address listed above under Section 17 titled “Contact Information.” Please note that some information, excluding claims data information provided by CMS as part of the “Blue Button” program, may remain in XFinitive’s records even after you request deletion of your CCPA/CPRA Personal Information, to the extent required by applicable laws. Additionally, there may be limits to the amount of information XFinitive can practically provide. For example, we may limit access to CCPA/CPRA Personal Information where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to an individual’s privacy or where doing so would violate others’ rights.
18.5.1 Right to Opt Out of the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information :
As noted above, you have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your CCPA/CPRA Personal Information to third parties. To exercise this right, you can visit the “Your Privacy Choices” section of our website. Additionally, XFinitive processes opt-out preference signals in a frictionless manner communicated through Global Privacy Control settings you may turn on in certain browsers through its vendor, OneTrust.  18.5.2 Right to Limit Certain Uses of Sensitive Personal Information :
You also have the right to limit the use or disclosure of your CCPA/CPRA Sensitive Personal Information if used to infer characteristics about you. To exercise this right, please visit the “Your Privacy Choices” section of our website. XFinitive may continue using Sensitive Personal Information for certain purposes expressly permitted by the CCPA/CPRA.  18.5.3 How to Exercise All Consumer Rights :
If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please complete the CCPA/CPRA Consumer Rights Request Form. You may also call us toll-free at +1 (866) 888-6929.We will review your requests and respond accordingly. The rights described herein are not absolute and we reserve all our rights available to us at law in this regard. Additionally, if we retain your CCPA/CPRA Personal Information only in de-identified form, we will not attempt to re-identify your data in response to a Consumer Rights request.
If you make a request related to CCPA/CPRA Personal Information about you, you will be required to supply a valid means of identification as a security precaution. We will verify your identity with a reasonably high degree of certainty using the following procedure where feasible: we will match identifying information you provide when making the request to the CCPA/CPRA Personal Information maintained by XFinitive or use a third-party identity verification service. If it is necessary to collect additional information, XFinitive will use the information only for verification purposes and will delete it as soon as practicable after complying the request. For requests related to particularly sensitive information, we may require additional proof of identification.
If you make a Consumer Rights request through an authorized agent, we will require written proof that the agent is authorized to act on your behalf.  We will process your request within the time provided by applicable law.  18.6 Other California Privacy Rights – Shine a Light :
In addition to the rights already described, California’s Shine the Light law permits California residents to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business must either provide this information or permit California customers to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing.  We may from time to time elect to share certain information about you collected by us through the Services with third parties or affiliates for those third parties’ or affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident, you may opt out of such future sharing of your personal information (as defined by the California Shine the Light law) by contacting us at info@xFinitive.com  with the phrase “Do Not Share” in the subject line.18.7 XFinitive as Service Provider :
